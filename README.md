# KOD2

First things first. This is not a superset of coed. It's a completely different language. KOD2 was chosen just cause I wanted to make coed better.

Also, from now on, __all__ versions of kod and all new programming languages I make will now use __.kod__.

Don't get confused. And yes, even though they use *.kod*, they are named different, cause technically, if all programming languages I make use the same file type, are they really the same language? So from now on, I will use .kod as the file type and instead of calling it **E+++++ Programming Language**, I'll call it ***E+++++ Kod Compiler***

Now that I got that out of the way, here's the image I'll be using for KOD2.

Better than XDC?
